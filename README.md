# ScanMan
ScanMan is the amalgamation of Masscan, Metasploit Framework (MSF), Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE) and EyeWitness.
This Python3 script-wrapper was developed in mind to streamline <i>my</i> workflow during the initial "scanning" phase of an internal network pentest by linking together the aforementioned tools with a shared database and preconfigured cmdline arguments.
